        <h2>I love...</h2>
        <p>My family. They bring action to my life and keep my emotions running! I have a husband - we're not married, but together over thirty years, so I see him as my husband. We have a 29 year old daugther together. She lives with her boyfriend. But when she needs somebody, we're always the ancor and she's ours.</p>
        <img src="images/dogwalk.jpg" alt="Playing dogs" class="card-image">
        <p>Our dogs. They keep me sain and - almost - fit. Mailo, our Golden Retriever, is fourteen years old, and he's getting old and slow. He doesn't like to be alone anymore and begins to bark after a while. Our other dog is a 9 years old German Sheppard named Kira. At home she's like a toy - you can do about anything with her, she's always happy and shows it. Outside she's the fierce gard-dog and barks at all the other dogs.</p>

        <h2>Wishes</h2>
        <p>I wish that the next several years will be better - we had a few hard knocks the past ten years. I hope that my over ninty year old parents, living at a retired home since this February, will still living a long time. And - like probably anybody - I wish that this damn pandemia finally finds its end and doesn't keep on splitting people apart because of their opposite opinions!</p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I have a lot of hobbies. Some of them are:</p>
        <ul class="hobbies">
          <li>Reading books</li>
          <li>Learning to code</li>
          <li>Gaming while watching TV</li>
          <li>Walk my dogs</li>
          <li>Cooking with my daughter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Techdegree Slack Channels</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of my FEWD Techdegree three years ago, I felt inapt of everything having to do with coding. This absolutely awesome slack community helped me out of it, and I began actively participating a lot. This was the best decision, asking for help there and helping others in turn helped me get better and more sure of myself.
        </p>
        <p>Not to forget: I gained friends from all over the world!</p>
        <p>My advice: Be active in the techdegree slack channels and do a lot of peer reviews - you won't regret that experience!</p>
